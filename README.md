The age of a person can be counted differently in different cultures. This calculator is based on the most common age system. In this system, age grows at the birthday. For example, the age of a person that has lived for 3 years and 11 months is 3 and the age will turn to 4 at his/her next birthday one month later. Most western countries use this age system.
